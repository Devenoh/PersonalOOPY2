/*
* Ok look since this is unfinished, whoever reads this should know :
* When you run the app class, click domestic, the other two won't work.
* When you click domestic, it'll open a file explorer. Don't be alarmed.
* Just select the 3 text files I put in with the classes.
* In order, select ingredients, then reminder1, then reminder2.
* Once you do that, it'll bring you to the actual interface. Sorry if this is a bit confusing.
